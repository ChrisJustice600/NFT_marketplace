# NFT Marketplace 🚀

Welcome to the **NFT Marketplace** repository! This project is an Ethereum marketplace built with Truffle for interacting with smart contracts and deploying them. It also uses Moralis for seamless interaction with web3 on the React DApp. This repository serves as a foundation for creating your own NFT marketplace or any DApp on EVM-compatible blockchains like Polygon, Avalanche, and Binance Smart Chain.
